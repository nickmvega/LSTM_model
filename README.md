This project aims to predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price movements using a comprehensive data-driven approach. The model is built on a robust feature set incorporating correlated assets, technical indicators, Fourier transforms, and ARIMA models, all processed and visualized using pandas and matplotlib. 

The core of the model is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, specifically designed for time-series forecasting. Through Bayesian optimization, the hyperparameters of the LSTM model are fine-tuned to improve accuracy and performance, enabling the model to effectively capture temporal dependencies and market patterns in an increasingly complex financial landscape.
